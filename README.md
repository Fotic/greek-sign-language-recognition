## 3. Training
The training of the sign language recognition model for the Greek alphabet was conducted using Google Teachable Machines. This innovative platform allowed us to harness the power of machine learning to create a highly accurate and efficient system for recognizing and interpreting Greek sign language gestures. Through extensive data collection and model refinement, we've made significant strides in bridging communication gaps and promoting accessibility for the Greek sign language community.
